# Simon Game
Simon is a memory game. It is based on the simple children’s game “Simon says”. The game creates a series of tones and patterns and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the <b>game</b> is <b>over.</b>

To begin, press <span color="red">any</span> key to start. After starting, try to follow and maintain the sequence. If you fail to do so, the game ends and you have to start all over again. This is a basic code created using JavaScript.
